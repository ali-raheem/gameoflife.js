# Game of Life in Javascript v0.1.3

A simple [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) simulator in javascript. Once the page loads it runs a [glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_%28Conway's_Life%29) animated on the HTML5 canvas.

#### Why?

I have never coded a game of life simulator and felt it would be a good way to try out javascript.

### Running

A live demo is on [github pages here](https://wolfmankurd.github.io/gameoflife.js/).

Open index.htm in any browser supporting HTML5 and javascript.

It will run a demo called "mess", most things in game of life look like a mess.
It will also add a glider from the top right corner.

### To do

* Interaction.
* Pause, step and run controls.
* Screenshot & GIF creation
